//random() method gives you a random value between 0 and 1..

/*
 		1) Methods (getRandomLetters()) should be created in Classes
		2) to create a method
			i)Type "access modifier": There are 4 access modifiers
			a) global: It can be accessed even from other applications
				b) public: It can be accessed from entire project like "public library"
				c) protected: It can be used from inner classes
				d) private: It can be used just from inside the class the data was created. 	
			ii)Type "return type": Data type which the method will give you in return
			iii)Type method name: a) methodName should summar≈üze the functionality
								  b) use camelCase when you name a method
			iv)Put method parenthesis: From the parenthesis, Apex can understand it is a method
			v) Use {}: the between the curly brackets is called "Method Body"
 
            Ex: public String getRandomLetters(){
            			Method body in brackets
            }
